# 5 Day Weather Dash
​
## Creating a Weather Dash with OpenWeatherAPI

### Live site at [Weather Dash](https://cgsdesign.github.io/weather-dash/)
​
​For this project I created a webpage that displays current weather and a 5 day forecast for various city's around the world. I used OpenWeatherAPI to collect the data I needed. The page is designed to be visually enticing and encourage the user to get outside and consider traveling.

## Key Features
* daily forecasts based on city inputs
* weather icons and bright design targeting young travelers
* fully responsive design
* past city lookups to make searching easier
* color coded UV index
* clear internal documentation
